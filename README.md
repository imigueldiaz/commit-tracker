## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/commit-tracker.git
cd commit-tracker
```
2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Initialize the database:
```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```
5. Run the application:
```bash
flask run
```
## üí° Usage

### Branch Setup
1. Create branches with appropriate order and dependencies
2. Define independent branches for hotfixes or parallel development
3. Customize branch colors for visual distinction

### Commit Management
1. Create commits with VSTFS numbers and optional JIRA tickets
2. Add detailed descriptions using Markdown
3. Attach relevant files (images, documents, etc.)
4. Move commits between branches following defined flows

### Viewing and Reporting
1. View branch flow diagram
2. Track commit transitions
3. Monitor branch dependencies
4. View commit details and attachments

## üîí Security Features
- Attachment ownership validation
- Branch transition validation
- Input sanitization
- Error handling and logging

## üê≥ Docker Setup

The application can be run using Docker Compose, which sets up the Flask application with SQLite database support.

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Build and start the container:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Initialize the database (first time only):
```bash
docker-compose exec web flask db upgrade
```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:5000

### Development with Docker

When developing with Docker, you can use the following commands to interact with the application:

1. Running Flask Commands:
```bash
# Create database migrations
docker-compose exec web flask db migrate -m "migration message"

# Apply migrations
docker-compose exec web flask db upgrade

# Access Flask shell
docker-compose exec web flask shell
```

2. Running Python Scripts:
```bash
# Import data
docker-compose exec web python import_data.py

# Export data
docker-compose exec web python export_data.py
```

3. Development Workflow:
- Code changes are automatically reflected in the container thanks to volume mounting
- After making changes to Python files, restart the container:
  ```bash
  docker-compose restart web
  ```
- For database schema changes:
  1. Modify models in `app/models.py`
  2. Create migration: `docker-compose exec web flask db migrate -m "change description"`
  3. Apply migration: `docker-compose exec web flask db upgrade`

### Stopping the Application

To stop the application:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

Note: The SQLite database file is stored in the `instance` directory, which is persisted through Docker volumes.
